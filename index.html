                <p>My name is Anibal Guerra, just in case you didn't see the big title there. You pronouce it
                  ON_KNEE_BALL
                  GER-RA most people have a hard time saying it. I'm 23 and I really enjoy the outdoors when ever I have
                  spare
                  time
                  between work and school. I am also planning a wedding so things can get pretty difficult. I work in
                  the
                  automotive industry, just dealing with parts mostly. I also have an associates in applied science for
                  automotive.</p>
                <p>This was
                  always goint to be my backup plan, but life happened and 4 years later I'm finally starting to pursue
                  what I
                  have
                  always wanted to do. Coding is something that has peaked my curosity. Building something from nothing
                  is
                  just
                  such an amzaing feeling. I'm lucking to be able to have this opportunity in my life. Other then
                  building
                  things
                  from
                  nothing I like to go fishing, or camping mostly year round.</p>
                <div class="p1">
                  <p0>Living in such a small town you usually
                    have
                    more then one hobby other then fishing and camping. I enjoy building computers and going to the
                    shooting
                    range.
                    Hobbies
                    get pretty expensive, and fast.</p0>
